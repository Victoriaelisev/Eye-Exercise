Overview:

This coding exercise involves creating a set of eyes that move around the eye socket based on the movement of the computer mouse. The eyes should be able to move smoothly and track the movement of the mouse as it moves across the screen.

Instructions:

Clone the repository containing the starter code to your local machine.

Open the file containing the starter code in your preferred code editor.

Review the code to familiarize yourself with the structure of the project.

Implement the necessary code to make the pupils of the eyes track the movement of the mouse.

Test your code to ensure that the eyes are moving smoothly and tracking the movement of the mouse as expected.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to the project maintainer for assistance.

Additional Notes:

The starter code includes basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
The project utilizes the jQuery library for handling DOM manipulation and event handling.
You may use any additional libraries or resources as needed to complete the project.
The final solution should be tested in modern web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
